## Pattern-Classification-and-Recognition
1. **Theory and practice of recognition technology**:  ```pattern classification```, ```pattern recognition```, ```automatic computer decision-making algorithms```.   
2. **Applications** covered include medical diseases, severe weather, industrial parts, biometrics, bioinformation, animal behavior patterns, 
image processing, and human visual systems. Perception as an integral component of intelligent systems.    
3. This course prepares students for advanced study of ```data fusion```, ```data mining```, knowledge base construction, problem-solving methodologies of "intelligent agents" and 
the design of intelligent control systems.    

The topics covered in this course include:
* Classifier performance evaluation and cross-validation   
* Probabilistic classifiers   
* Linear and non-linear classifiers   
* Kernel classifiers   
* Clustering   
* Data pre-processing and feature generation   
* Feature selection
